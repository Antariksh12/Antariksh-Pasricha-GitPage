            🎭 A Remarkable Journey in Sound & Storytelling 🎶
          </h1>

          <div class="post-body">
            <p>
              It was such a remarkable and fulfilling experience to work on the
              background score for the play “The Princess Who Forgot to Laugh”
              at St. Kabir Public School, Chandigarh.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was so much more than just composing — it was about
              listening, experimenting, and co-creating. From live recordings,
              sampling, and editing, to crafting multiple layers for both the
              vocal and dance departments, every step brought new sounds and
              smiles.
            </p>
            <p>
              The play — an Indian adaptation of a Norwegian story by the same
              name — carried a beautiful mix of ethnic textures and playful
              tones. We brought in sounds like matka, dhol, kanjira, and even
              synthesized layers blending organic and digital samples.
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot of sounds — from guitar and keyboard textures to giggles,
              chimes, and spontaneous sound elements — were recorded live during
              the sessions, which added so much life and authenticity to the
              final mix. Every take captured a small moment of joy, helping the
              score feel as alive as the story itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most exciting parts was live-syncing the score with
              rehearsals. We’d experiment with transitions, tweak tempos, and
              evolve ideas together — watching the music grow in rhythm with the
              narrative. Those light-hearted conversations, laughs, and bursts
              of creativity made the process truly unforgettable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Handling everything from pre-production to recording, layering,
              composition and live syncing was a rich learning experience that
              deepened my love for sound and storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Heartfelt thanks to Deeptha Vivekanand, the director of the show,
              for her trust, vision, and continued belief in me. Collaborating
              with her and the wonderful team was pure joy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Feeling grateful for this journey — and excited to take on more
              projects that blend music, theatre, and creative storytelling. If
              you’re working on something where sound can bring the narrative
              alive, I’d love to connect and co-create. 🌿

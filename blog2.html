              Honored and Grateful 🌿🎶 Presenting at an international
              conference — that too at Bhatkhande Sanskriti Vishwavidyalaya,
              Lucknow, a university where I once dreamt of studying — was a
              truly noble and humbling experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the Naad Nartan International Music Conference, organized in
              collaboration with the Ministry of Culture Govt. of India I had
              the opportunity to not only present two research papers but also
              perform Raag Yaman on the western instrument guitar. This
              experiment, blending the depth of Indian classical music with a
              modern instrument, received heartfelt appreciation from esteemed
              professors and senior dignitaries 🙏.
            </p>
            <p>
              What made the experience even more enriching was the chance to
              interact with professors and research scholars from across the
              world 🌏. The insightful exchanges, especially with scholars from
              Sri Lanka and my new friends from South India, opened new
              perspectives on music, culture, and pedagogy.
            </p>
            <p>
              📄 Research contributions at the conference: 1️⃣ Swar Gyan in the
              Digital Age: AI’s Expanding Role in Global Music Pedagogy (with
              special focus on Indian classical traditions) – Explored how
              modern AI tools can support pitch analysis, personalized feedback,
              and pedagogy while still honoring the timeless wisdom of the
              Guru–Shishya Parampara.
            </p>
            <p>
              2️⃣ Why Certain Music Feels Pure: A Frequency-Based Study of
              Shrutis, Natural Tuning, and the Psychoacoustic Appeal of Indian
              Ragas (co-authored with Mr. Aditya Bhatnagar, HOD Science, St.
              Kabir Public School) – Conducted six integrated science–music
              sessions with students, including pre-assessment questionnaires,
              listening activities, and live demonstrations of pure tuning. –
              Findings, inspired by Dr. Vidyadhar Oke’s pioneering research on
              the 22 Shrutis, revealed how natural frequency-based tuning
              resonates with the ear and mind, explaining why certain ragas
              sound so “pure.”
            </p>
            <p>
              🙏 My heartfelt gratitude to my parents, my Guruji, Pt. Harvinder
              Sharma Sir, whose guidance has shaped my musical journey, and to
              Prof. Ravi Sharma Sir, Convenor of the Naad Nartan Conference, for
              this wonderful platform. Thankyou Prof. Rohitha Eshwar sir and Dr.
              Pragya Pyasi ma'am for the wonderful interactions. It was very
              insightful to speak to you both.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deep thanks also to my co-author Mr. Aditya Bhatnagar Sir for his
              valuable collaboration and insights, and to St. Kabir Public
              School, Administrator Gurpreet Bakshi Sir, and Principal Sapna
              Katoch Ma’am for blessing me with this opportunity and supporting
              such meaningful interdisciplinary research.
            </p>
            <p>
              ✨ This journey was both academic and artistic, reaffirming my
              belief that music education can be most impactful when it brings
              together tradition, innovation, and scientific inquiry. It has
              strengthened my mission to contribute towards creating a more
              holistic approach to global music education.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would love to know your thoughts: How do you see the future of
              blending tradition and technology in music education?
